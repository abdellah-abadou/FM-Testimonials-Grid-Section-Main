## My process

I worked on this project for about two and a half hours. In fact, there are some points that I did not work on because I wanted to finish the project quickly. The code works, but it is not the best.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learn  CSS grid

### Continued development

I want to improve the way I write my code to become cleaner, and learn more about CSS properties
